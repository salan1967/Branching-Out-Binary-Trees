# Branching-Out-Binary-Trees
In this project, I set out on implementing several key methods for a Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java, focusing on integer-based operations. The task is to complete the stubbed-out methods in BSTImpl.java using the method descriptions provided in BST.java, without modifying the latter. The assignment involves implementing functions such as insert(), findMin(), findMax(), and others, with guidance from already implemented methods like contains() and height(). Since pointer manipulation is crucial in BST operations, careful debugging and step-by-step tracing were crucial. Through this assignment, I strengthened my understanding of BST traversal, insertion, retrieval, and structural properties in Java. ðŸŒ³âœ¨
